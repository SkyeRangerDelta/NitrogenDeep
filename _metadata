  "description" : "Mod that adds a new planet similar to Frackin Universe's Nitrogen Sea (but a bit colder). It is simply a massive liquid nitrogen expanse without a large terrain covering; like an Arctic world. It spawns around Dying Stars, Frozen Stars, and Blue Stars. Note that uninstallation requires a universe wipe.",
